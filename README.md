Algorithms implemented in c

1- Bubble sort equation (size-1)^2 for e.g to sort array with 5 elements it will be (5-1)^2 = 16 process to do that


2- Linear Search go to throw every element in array to search specific keyword on it worest case senairo key last index for 10 elements it's will take 10 process to get the needed key in last element

3- Binary Search it's working with bubble sort algorithm you should sort your input for use binary search bubble sort algorithm included in example binary search use log(n) however equation meaning for search in 32 element in array binary search should take 5 steps faster than linear search would take 32 seqenuatil search 2^n = 2^5 = 32
4- Stack Data structure example Algorithm LIFO Last in first out
